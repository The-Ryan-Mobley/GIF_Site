# GIF_Site
This is website uses the GIPHY api to pull a series of gifs based on selected tag keywords. The site loads with a few default tags, 
but the user can add more with the search bar. Users can also delete tags by clicking on them. As users scroll down more gifs will 
load at 2 second intervals with infinite scrolling.
